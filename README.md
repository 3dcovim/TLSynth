# TLSynth-V.1
Add-on for Blender: Laser scanner simulator of 3D environments defined by meshes in Blender.

The goal of this Blender is double:
- Generating repository of data (point clouds or meshes) for research purpose.
- Planning the scanning process of real environments.

# Features
The current version of this add-on provides the following features:
* Definition of angle and range for every scanner
* Three alternatives for the generated data: point cloud, mesh or sparse points.
* Three alternatives for the color representation: solid color, distance-based color, texture-based color
* Exportation of PLY of point clouds with RGB color and scalar fields (distance, frame): Combined (all scanners in scene) or isolated (per scanner).
* Exportation of PLY resulting of the animation of a scanner.
* Generation of simple top view map of the target mesh and scanners location, for planning the scanning campaign.
